<p class="desc">We're students, designers, dreamers, programmers, and so much more. As members of the <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/">Girls Who Code</a>
            <br> summer immersion program, we have spent a substantial amount of time perfecting our site to be tailored for every student<br>
            with different preferences and needs. As students ourselves, we understand what is significant to students in the
          <br> college research and application process. Our website is designed to take the college setting, region, school type, and population
        <br> into consideration and give students college results that they'll be satisfied with.</p>

<p class="desc">Created in July 2018, our website is dedicated to helping students feel more confident <br> about
              their college choices. The college application and decision process can be stressful, and as students
            <br> ourselves, we understand how stressful it can be. Thanks to our website, students can now take a short
          (less than 15 minute) <br> quiz and relax while MyCollegeWingman does all the college research for you!</p>
